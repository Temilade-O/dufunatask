        <p> Software development is the process of developing software through successive phases in an orderly way.</h1>
         This process includes not only the actual writing of code but also the preparation of requirements and objectives, the design of what is to be coded and confirmation that what is developed has met objectives.</h4>

             <h2><em>Software development Lifecycle (SDLC)</em></h2>
                 <p>This is a framework for defining tasks performend at each step in the Software Development process.</p>
                <div> The SDLC lifecycle goes in this manner:

                        <li>Planning</li>
                        <li>Analyis ans Design</li>
                        <li>Implemetation</li>
                        <li>Integration and Testing</li>
                        <li>Maintainance</li> </strong>
